**Update:** Breaking change to Mapping collection literals delimiters.

The syntax of Mapping literals currently use square brackets for delimiters:
```cp
[a1 |-> c1, a2 |-> c2, a3 |-> c3];
```
They will now be replaced with curly braces:
```cp
{a1 |-> c1, a2 |-> c2, a3 |-> c3};
```
This change aligns with a future Set literal syntax:
```cp
{i1, i2, i3};
```
