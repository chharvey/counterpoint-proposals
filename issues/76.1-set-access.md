This comment updates and supercedes parts of the previous comment.

Set access can be done via bracket accessor notation, where the value produced is a boolean indicating whether the element is in the set.
```cp
let s: Set.<str> = {'hello', 'world'};
s.['hello']; %== true
s.['hi'];    %== false
s.[42];      %> TypeError
```
A TypeError is reported at compile-time if the type of the accessed element does not match the set’s invariant. In the example above, `s` is of type `Set.<str>` (the set’s invariant is type `str`), so accessing `.[42]` produces a type error since `42` is not a string. In other words, since it’s not even possible for an integer to exist in the set at all, compilation is stopped.

Optional access and claim access are irrelevant, since the returned value will always be a boolean.
```cp
s?.['hello']; %== true
s?.['hi'];    %== false
s?.[42];      %> TypeError
s!.['hello']; %== true
s!.['hi'];    %== false
s!.[42];      %> TypeError
```

When using bracket accessor notation to mutate a mutable set, setting the value `true` will add the element to the set (if it’s not already added), and setting `false` will remove the element (if it’s not already removed). Type errors are as usual.
```cp
let s: mut str{} = {'hello', 'world'};
set s.['hi'] = true;
s; %== {'hello', 'world', 'hi'}
set s.['hello'] = false;
s; %== {'world', 'hi'}
set s.[42] = true; %> TypeError
set s.['world'] = anything_but_a_boolean; %> TypeError
```

In a way, set access can be treated like map access where the map’s keys (antecedents) are elements of the set and the map’s values (consequents) are boolean.
