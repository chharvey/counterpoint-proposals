**Update:** Only punning will be implemented, with a slight change in syntax. Augmentation will not be developed for arguments.

```cp
function scientist(firstname: str, lastname: str): str {
	return '''{{ firstname }} {{ lastname }}''';
}

let firstname: str = 'Albert';
let lastname:  str = 'Einstein';

scientist.(firstname= firstname, lastname= lastname);
scientist.(firstname$, lastname$);                    % equivalent to above
```

**This completely supercedes the previous.**

Syntax diff is equivalent to #24.
