**Primitives and Statements.** A program has multiple expression-statements. Expressions include the literal values of `null`, booleans, integers, floats. Relational and logical operators are included in addition to the basic mathematical operators. Logical operators are short-circuited. Line comments, multiline comments, and block comments may be interspersed in between tokens.
A type error will be thrown at compile time if an operation is performed on incompatible types.
