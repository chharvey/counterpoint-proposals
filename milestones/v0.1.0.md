**A Simple Calculator.** A program is a single expression with integers (base 10 only), simple operators, and grouping symbols. The program will be tokenized, parsed, compiled, evaluated, and it will produce a numerical output when run. Since the tokens of the expression are integers only, the computed output will be an integer (which might not be mathematically accurate).

A lexical error will be thrown if a program fails to tokenize, a syntax error will be thrown if a program fails to parse, and a runtime error will be thrown if the program fails to fully execute.
