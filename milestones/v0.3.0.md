**Variables and Types.** Statements include variable declarations, type declarations, reassignment statements, and augmentation statements. Variables are either fixed or unfixed and are accessed via identifiers. Variable types are explicitly declared. Expressions include variable identifiers and constants. Type declarations include type operations.
A semantic error is thrown at compile time if references or assignments are invalid.
